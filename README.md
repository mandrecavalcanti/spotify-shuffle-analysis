# Analysis of the Spotify Shuffle Algorithm

This repository holds functions and data to analyze the randomness of the Spotify shuffle algorithm. The algorithm is often suspected to be non-random, to favor certain songs in a playlist and to repeat many songs. This statistical analysis should help to better understand the algorithm and prove or disprove the assumptions. [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/i9k6in/spotify_shuffle_needs_to_be_fixed_and_you_know/) might be interesting to read in this context.

## Experiments
The analysis is currently a work-in-progress.

### Experiment 1
Experiment 1 represents the shuffle behaviour over one complete music library run. If the Spotify music library holds `n` tracks, the shuffle behaviour of `n` track skips without interruption is analyzed.

### Experiment 2
Experiment 2 represents the shuffle behaviour over multiple, smaller music library runs. If the Spotify library holds `n` tracks and one run skips `m` tracks, the shuffle behaviour of `n` track skips in `r = n / m` runs with a restart of the playback in every run `r` is analyzed.
